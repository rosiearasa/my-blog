## a book by Muriel Barbery

<p>
  Can one find books that just make so much sense yet they seem to drive you to
  understand more about yourself and feel a plethora of emotions after reading
  that book that you just want to re-read it but you start to lack the energy to
  go through the trauma of the impossible outcome of events that you just did
  not see coming! Or to say simply, ***I REALLY REALLY LOVED*** the book.
</p>

<p>
  I have a special place in my heart for The Elegance of the Hegdghog by Muriel
  Barbery and its one of those books that made me identify with a fact I have
  always known to be true. That all books are perfect you just have to read them
  at the precisely right period of moments.

<p>
  Murielâ€™s Paloma and Renee made me cry, laugh, gasp and sometimes disagree
  with. I was taken through the idiosyncrasies of the invisible who seem to have
  a better grasp of reality albeit not the perfect rosy colored one but the
  naked and bare reality and acceptance of the fateful design of the cruel world
  that exists for both the ones sitting highest on the pedestal of life and the
  low feeders. The greatest parts of the book were the humor with which Renee
  studied those around her and how much she looked down upon them even though on
  the outside she seemed like one who should have more misery than judgement on
  her employers.

<p>
  Paloma, Strong character, dangerously witty and very observant has very
  definite takes on a lot of topics and a deep appreciation for Japanese culture
  which really became a curious character study and learn from. Philosophy and
  Literature were exalted and written about with so much grace that the effect
  on my personality was a serious study and deep dive on the stack of books on
  philosophy that I have collecting dust on my desk.
</p>

<p>
  There is nothing not to appreciate about the book, metaphors, literature,
  characters, philosophy and even the tragic end was well thought through. I
  think if you can bear a lot of digression which sounds a lot like invasive
  thoughts in the minds of the characters you will be pleased with the book.
  Your life might even be changed!
