# What are Distributed Systems
Whatsapp is a distributed social media system that focuses on communication, Instagram is a distributed system as well 
as Amazon. They exist in all the digital products that require many people to either communicate or make some type of transactions.
Almost all digital systems are distributed systems including this site even though all those things are abstracted and hidden from the end user- YOU, IN THE CASE OF THIS WEBSITE. 
If you do not have any business building or managing software then you do not have to know the nitty gritty details about how things work. That is the idea behind abstraction.
In order to understand distributed systems we have to start with what was before distributed systems.
Once upon a time jk...;. Before distributed systems there would be no need for one. This is possible if we do not need our site to exist in a public domain where everyone would have to have 
some type of access to it. Our site would either sit in the memory of our computer just like most file systems or in a single server. In this case let's assume our site exists on a single server. Which means that everything that serves our site exists in one logical location (the server).
The componets we are talking about here are:
    1. User Interface(the window to our application or website): all users basically have access to this.
    2. The Domain Name System: This is the address that is reserved in the internet "phonebook for our site". The identity is further detailed as an IP address.
