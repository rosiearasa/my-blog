**Scalability**
- As the demands from a system grow; systems designed efficiently should be able to handle the increase in traffic volume, data volume or complexity with reasonable performance. There should be systems set up to handle the growth
    - If a system grows in a certain way do we have a system in place to deal with the growth?
        - Load - the current load on a system can be in terms of requests per second to web server, reads : writes in a database, number of simultaneous users in a chat room etc
            - We need to have a system in place to handle unexpected spike in traffic/load to enable the performance of ur system to meet the target
        - Performance: 
            - Throughput - the number of requests a system can process per second
            - Response time- the time elapsed between a client sending a request and receiving a response. 
            - Latency - a duration that a request is waiting to be handled.
        - Approaches to Copping with Load
            - Vertical scaling
            - Horizontal Scaling

**Reliability**
- A well designed system should be able to continue working correctly despite errors, outages in both software or hardware components. This system needs to be fault tolerant.
	When is s system said to be reliable:
	- performs expected user functions.
	- can tolerate user errors: making mistakes or using software incorrectly.
	- good performance for required use case under expected load and volume.
	- system prevents unauthorized access and abuse.

**Maintainability**
- It should be seamless for many developers to work on a system while maintaining the current behavior and adapting new use cases productively
    - Operability
        - Ease of keeping the system running smoothly
    - Simplicity
        - Removing unnecessary complexity making the system easy to understand.
    - Evolvability
        - Easy to make changes to the system and adopting it for unexpected use cases.
