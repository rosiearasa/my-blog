**Introduction to State Management In Flutter**
</p>
<p>

	- State management comes up when we start passing data between screens and we want to make out app more interactive with navigation eg: screen to screen, performing actions such add adding an item into a cart etc
	- We can use the setState() build in functionality with init(), dispose() and whenever we are updating any data that needs to be reflected on the UI.
		- This method is expensive when we have a parent widget with children widgets since the ui has to be redrawn recursively : all the children widgets must be redrawn.
	- State management is therefore better left to packages such as Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, GetIt, Redux etc. because the performance is optimized and a lot of the boiler plate code you will need to implement when using setState() is abstracted neatly.
	- A lot of factors may influence your choice of state management libraary but the most important one is to use a library that is mantained religiously by its authors and is appropriate for your app's use case.
