**Learning Dutch, Japanese and French**
</p>
<p>
There used to be real reasons why people ever did things but I am past the age where I actually need a reason to emback on a hobby.
I am a 20 something Woman in Tech who needs a constant need for intellectual stimulation otherwise my mind is unstable in idle thought.
Is it not enough not to have concrete reasons for embaking on **Language Learning** given that is what I already do for a living to communicate with machines.
I want to communucate with people and stay close to the human condition and while at it ofcourse, indulge in Literature and Culture for my own selfish need for self validation and success.
Who Am I? I have no  idea. I just have these thoughts and to be able to continue them I must show up with my stamina and action to get things done. Do this for myself.
